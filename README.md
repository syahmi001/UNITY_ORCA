# UNITY_ORCA
 **ORCA implementation in UNITY Engine**

**Requirement:**
This simulation only works in the UNITY ENGINE
version 2017.3.0f3
You might need basic knowledge of using UnityEngine if you wish to change the parameters.
`All parameters can be changed in the GameObject.`

**How to launch:**
Open the scene files in the folder ORCA_ROS/Assets/Scenes.
Select which scene to run.
There are quite the few scenes I make but the main scenes are in the FYP2 folder.
The main 3 scenes are, 4 vs 4; Human walking scene; and Warehouse scene.

**Purpose/Aim**
The purpose/aim of this project is to see the performance of ORCA (or RVO2) in a simulated environment.
The algorithm is tested with different types of obstacles through different type of scenario.
